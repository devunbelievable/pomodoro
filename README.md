The **Pomodoro Technique** is a [time management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management "Time management") method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.It uses a [kitchen timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitchen_timer "Kitchen timer") to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a *pomodoro*, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used while he was a university student
